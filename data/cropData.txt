Tomato
Botanically called Solanum licopersicum, tomato plants are actually vines. If given adequate support they can grow up to 6 feet tall in traditional farming.
A warm but cool climate is needed for tomato. It cannot withstand frost. However, it cannot tolerate high light intensity as well since it affects the fruit pigmentation.
Although tomato needs a diverse set of climate for its growth, it can grow on all types of soils from light sandy soil to a heavy clayey soil. A well-drained soil with a depth of 15-20 cm is ideal for yielding a healthy crop.
General yield varies around 8-12 quintals per acre.
Requires investment around 200 per acre

Brinjal
Botanically called Solanum licopersicum, tomato plants are actually vines. If given adequate support they can grow up to 6 feet tall in traditional farming.
Brinjal is a warm season crop and requires a long warm growing season. It is very susceptible to frost. A daily mean temperature of 13-21 oC is most favourable for its successful production. The growth of the crop is severely affected when temperature falls below 17 oC.
Brinjal can be grown in all soils including light sandy soil, rich loamy soil, clay loamy soil, and silt loamy soil.
General yield varies around 12-16 quintals per acre.
Requires investment around 200 per acre

Rice
Rice (Oryza sativa) is a type of cereal and food. In origin, it is a swamp grass. It is eaten as staple food in many parts of Asia. It is grown in warm parts of the world, mainly Asia, Africa, northern Italy, and the west coast of North America.
Rice grows best in areas of warm, humid climate; rice requires temperatures between 20°C and 35°C and a well-distributed rainfall of about 100 cm or irrigation facilities. 
Fertile soil. Delta and valley soils are the most suitable.
General yield varies around 22-25 quintals per acre.
Requires investment around 200 per acre

Wheat
Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food. The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common Wheat.
Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 centimeters) of water to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm, from 70° to 75° F (21° to 24° C), but not too hot. Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling.
Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.
General yield varies around 17-18 quintals per acre.
Requires investment around 200 per acre

Onion
The onion also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is a vegetable that is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium.
Onions need cool and pleasant weather without humidity and rain. Thus, the best time to grow onions is between November and February. Any open space or even a container can be used for growing the bulb. But ensure that the soil is fertile and porous.
Onion can be grown in all types of soils such as sandy loam, clay loam, silt loam and heavy soils. However, the best soil for successful onion cultivation is deep, friable loam and alluvial soils with good drainage, moisture holding capacity and sufficient organic matter.
General yield varies around 12-13 quintals per acre.
Requires investment around 200 per acre
